Good Code needs to be readable and scalable.

Big O measures the efficiency of an algorithm. In essences it measures which one is better when it comes to scale and which one takes longer.

As elements increase or grow bigger and bigger how much the algorithm or the function slow. Algorithmic efficiency.

O(n) -> Linear Time. Big O of N. It takes linear time to find N. N can be any variable.
N stands for the number of inputs / elements of the variable. Most common.
