4 pillars of OOP
Abstraction => Abstracting away the details. User does not need to worry about how the details actually work. Finding things that are similar in your code and providing a function or object to serve that purpose.

Encapsulation => how you actually hide away your data and code. Binding your data to something, whether it is a class, object, module or function and keeping it as separate as you can.

Inheritance => Lets one object acquire the properties and methods of another object. Reusability is main benefit.

Polymorphism => The condition of occurring in several different forms.
types in the same inheritance chains being able to do different things. Sharing behaviors / methods from the parents but also allowing its own overrides to properties and methods if needed.
